## ABOUT
Useful bash scripts for MSYS users

Some utils requires context (environment variables). Ex. GITUSER for bb* utils, SVN_REPOS for csvn* utils, etc.

My advice - use Conemu and extend PATH var to easy lunch utils in CLI

### INSTALL (BASH):
	clone https://github.com/bisoff/utils.git utils
	cd utils
	pathadd "$PWD"

### INSTALL (CMD):

	clone https://github.com/bisoff/utils.git utils
	cd utils
	bash -c "pathadd '%CD%'"

if bash is not in PATH then use:

	path\to\bash.exe -c "pathadd '%CD%'"
